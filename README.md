# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Escape.exe


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An interactive game in which the user will be confronted with puzzles in order to escape the room and finish the game

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will begin by prompting the user with background information for the storyline of the game. The theme of the game will be dark and eerie. For example, the user will wake up in an unknown location where they are prompted to choose between 3 doors, all with different outcomes. After the user will be given multiple choices, there will be puzzles for the user to solve in order to progress within the game. These puzzles will consist of hangman, brain teasers, turtle tag, and turtle hide and seek. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We think that a good outcome will result in something that can be interactive, where the user can make certain decisions in order to progress.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be us able to complete all of the games to the best of our ability within the deadline!


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for our final project would allow for the user to play multiple mini games and in order to reach the end of the game, they must complete all four games. In addition, there will be a storyline of some sort that will prompt the user to play all of the games in order to escape. It would also include some aesthetic graphics like that used in the hurricane tracker.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We already have some knowledge in the area of prompting the user to input their choice. However, we need to expand on these skills in order to prompt the user to select options in an interactive way. In addition, we are going to need to further our knowledge of turtles and research more available functions with the turtle. We will need to research interactive code, how to add more believable visuals and graphics to the code, and how we can create radial buttons. In terms of dividing up the work, we have decided that each group member will initially focus on one of the games. However, we will continuously check up on each other and help the rest of our group members in any way that we can and we will communicate regarding the set up and execution of the game.
